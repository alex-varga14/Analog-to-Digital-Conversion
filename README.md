# Analog to Digital Conversion
 Using Potentiometer to verify microcontrollers ADC
 ---
 * ADC conversion on the analog voltage that the potentiometer induces on pin of microcontroller
 * 1000 measurements stored each second to sample
 * Generate horizontal bar graph, width changing proportionally to ADC's digital output value
 * Idle when button not pressed
